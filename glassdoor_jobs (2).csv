Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (40 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us! Applications are accepted until further notice.

Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (40 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

International Business Machines Corporation,Junior Threat Detection Analyst,"Huntsville, AL",United States,"Introduction
A career in IBM Consulting is rooted by long-term relationships and close collaboration with clients across the globe.

You'll work with visionaries across multiple industries to improve the hybrid cloud and AI journey for the most innovative and valuable companies in the world. Your ability to accelerate impact and make meaningful change for your clients is enabled by our strategic partner ecosystem and our robust technology platforms across the IBM portfolio; including Software and Red Hat.

Curiosity and a constant quest for knowledge serve as the foundation to success in IBM Consulting. In your role, you'll be encouraged to challenge the norm, investigate ideas outside of your role, and come up with creative solutions resulting in ground breaking impact for a wide network of clients. Our culture of evolution and empathy centers on long-term career growth and development opportunities in an environment that embraces your unique skills and experience.

Your Role and Responsibilities
The Opportunity:

Cyber threats are evolving, and perimeter security and automated protection aren’t enough—it’s time to go threat hunting. We need your cyber knowledge to detect advanced cyber threats in Cloud and O365 environments as well as on servers and endpoints.
We’re looking for a Cyber Threat Hunter who can think like a cyber attacker to figure out how to circumvent security measures. This is an opportunity to use your analytical skills and gain network defense experience. You’ll learn to rapidly prototype and develop scripts to create haystacks where you’ll sift through the false positives to find patterns and indicators.
Learn from our team of Detection Engineers as you find the adversary in the SEIM’s blind spot to help us close the gaps and harden their network. This is a chance to think differently about cyber defense, use completely new tools and approaches, and develop the next generation of security analytics. Due to the nature of work performed within this facility, U.S. citizenship is required.

Knowledge of security principles, including MITRE ATT@CK framework, threat landscapes, or attacker TTPs
Knowledge on Security Tools in Application, Data, Networks, and Endpoint layers
Ability to leverage internal and external resources for research threats, vulnerabilities, and intelligence on various attackers and attack infrastructure
Ability to identify anomalous behavior on endpoint devices or network communications

Thomson Reuters Corporation,Cybersecurity Correspondent (Level 1 Journalist),"Ann Arbor, MI",United States,"Reuters News is looking for an experienced and ambitious Cybersecurity Correspondent (Level 1 Journalist) in San Francisco.
The successful candidate will have a track record of breaking news on the biggest data breaches, ransomware campaigns and the criminal organizations behind them. Hacking was once a concern mainly for computer professionals, but in recent years it has emerged as a major national security and law enforcement issue affecting governments, businesses and consumers around the globe. Numerous nation-states now employ hacking armies for espionage, occasional sabotage, and in some cases for profit. Criminal gangs are driving an epidemic of ransomware globally. With defensive measures lagging far beyond offensive strategies, the cybersecurity crisis is likely to be with us for some time.
The cybersecurity correspondent will report on major hacking incidents, with the aim of understanding how the attacks were carried out, who is behind them, what damage was done, whether defenses were adequate and how the victims and others responded. The correspondent will also work on deeper investigations of different aspects of cybersecurity, shedding light on a world that mostly operates in the shadows and tracking the evolving policy response by governments. The role is based in the U.S. and will have a special focus on developments there, but the story is global and the correspondent will frequently be involved in stories outside the region. The position involves intensive day-to-day collaboration with cyber team colleagues in Washington and London, and frequent work with non-specialist correspondents in bureaus around the world.
Cybersecurity reporting presents unique challenges due to the highly secretive nature of the field and the shadowy characters involved. By the same token, it can be richly rewarding, with many opportunities for the kind of high-impact journalism that the Reuters cyber team has delivered consistently in recent years.
About the Role
In this opportunity as Cybersecurity Correspondent (Level 1 Journalist), you will:
Develop a diverse range of sources that lead to scoops
Break exclusive news that rivals must follow
Lead and/or reinforce coverage of major news
Report aggressively to hold companies, regulators and law enforcement accountable
Write deeply-reported, standback stories on cybersecurity
Demonstrate beat expertise and dominance
Work with a global team of experienced reporters and editors writing about cybersecurity across the United States, Europe and Asia
About You
You’re a fit for the role of Cybersecurity Correspondent (Level 1 Journalist) if your background includes:
At least five years of journalism experience.
The ability to write quickly and accurately under deadline pressure.
Comfort with and aptitude for technology, as the beat involves highly technical topics and some of the reporting techniques require technical skills.
A track record on the cyber beat and an existing source network are desirable.
Strong inter-personal skills and the ability to work closely with a variety of collaborators.
Outstanding written English is essential. Proficiency in Chinese or Russian would be assets.

More information about Thomson Reuters can be found on https://thomsonreuters.com. Reuters News is looking for an experienced and ambitious Cybersecurity Correspondent (Level 1 Journalist) in San Francisco.
  Cybersecurity Correspondent (Level 1 Journalist)  The successful candidate will have a track record of breaking news on the biggest data breaches, ransomware campaigns and the criminal organizations behind them. Hacking was once a concern mainly for computer professionals, but in recent years it has emerged as a major national security and law enforcement issue affecting governments, businesses and consumers around the globe. Numerous nation-states now employ hacking armies for espionage, occasional sabotage, and in some cases for profit. Criminal gangs are driving an epidemic of ransomware globally. With defensive measures lagging far beyond offensive strategies, the cybersecurity crisis is likely to be with us for some time.
  The cybersecurity correspondent will report on major hacking incidents, with the aim of understanding how the attacks were carried out, who is behind them, what damage was done, whether defenses were adequate and how the victims and others responded. The correspondent will also work on deeper investigations of different aspects of cybersecurity, shedding light on a world that mostly operates in the shadows and tracking the evolving policy response by governments. The role is based in the U.S. and will have a special focus on developments there, but the story is global and the correspondent will frequently be involved in stories outside the region. The position involves intensive day-to-day collaboration with cyber team colleagues in Washington and London, and frequent work with non-specialist correspondents in bureaus around the world.  
Cybersecurity reporting presents unique challenges due to the highly secretive nature of the field and the shadowy characters involved. By the same token, it can be richly rewarding, with many opportunities for the kind of high-impact journalism that the Reuters cyber team has delivered consistently in recent years.

We invite applications from candidates who engage the diverse life experiences of our student body, who appreciate that students bring their holistic selves into the academic setting, and who recognize and articulate how their own life experiences and backgrounds have shaped their journeys, practices, and commitments as researchers, scholars, and educators.
